1. Entity Class (Domain Layer)

The Entity represents your core business concept. Its properties are defined based on what the application's business rules and use cases require, regardless of where the data comes from.

Focus: Business requirements, logic, and integrity.

Properties: Should include only the fields necessary for your application's Domain logic.

Example: If the API returns firstName and lastName, but your business logic only cares about a fullName, your Entity should have a fullName property (which might be a getter or a constructor-computed field), or simply name, even if the Model has two separate fields.

🧱 1. Entities — “What is my business object?”

An Entity is a pure Dart object that represents real-world data your app cares about.
Example: UserEntity
It tells your app what a “user” means, regardless of where it comes from.

💡 Analogy:
If you ask your app “what’s a user?”, the domain answers:

A user has an id, name, email, etc. — that’s it.

It doesn’t care if the data came from the internet, a file, or was hardcoded.

Entities are:

Simple Dart classes

Immutable (ideally)

Have only business data (no JSON, no UI logic)
