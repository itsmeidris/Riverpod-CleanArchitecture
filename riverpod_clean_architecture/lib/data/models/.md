2. Model Class (Data Layer)
The Model (or DTO - Data Transfer Object) represents the external data structure. Its properties are defined to exactly match the JSON structure from the API or the schema from the database.

Focus: Serialization, deserialization, and data access.

Properties: Should exactly mirror the fields and names from the API response or local cache structure.

Example: If the API uses user_id (snake_case) and full_name, the Model must use these exact names to map the JSON correctly.
