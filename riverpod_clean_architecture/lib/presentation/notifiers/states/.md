🧠 1. What Is “State” in Clean Architecture?

State = “The current situation of your app’s data.”
It could mean:

*The list of items fetched from the API
*Whether a screen is loading or not
*Whether a form submission succeeded or failed
---------------------------------------------

Why add custom states when <AsyncValue> works?
Custom states give you:

*More control over different loading states (initial load vs refresh vs load more)
*Additional data alongside your main data (pagination info, filters, etc.)
*Better semantics for your specific use case
*Easier to extend for complex features
