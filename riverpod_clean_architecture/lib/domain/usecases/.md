🧩 3. Use Case — “What is the app’s behavior?”
*A Use Case (or Interactor) represents one specific action your app performs.

So, when your UI or logic layer needs users, it doesn’t say:

“Call Dio and fetch users from this URL.”

Instead, it says:

“Execute the GetUsersUseCase.”
-------------------------------

In Flutter, use cases are only needed when you have actual business logic to coordinate. If your "use case" is just calling repository.someMethod(), skip it

Use this decision tree:
```
Does the operation:
├─ Touch multiple repositories? → Use Case
├─ Have complex business rules? → Use Case
├─ Need reuse across multiple screens? → Use Case
