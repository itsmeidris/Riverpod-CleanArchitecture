🌐 2. UserRemoteDataSource — The Data Fetcher

Purpose: It’s responsible for fetching the data from a specific source — in this case, the remote API.

✅ Responsibilities:

*Talks directly to the API using DioClient.
*Converts raw JSON into UserModel instances.
*Returns a list of models to the repository.

It doesn’t know anything about UI or domain logic — it only fetches data.
