⚙️ 2. Repository (Interface) — “What can I do with it?”

*The repository is an abstraction — it declares the actions your app can perform on entities.

It’s like a contract between the domain and the data world.
You’re saying:

“Hey, Data layer — I don’t care how you do it, but I expect you to give me a list of users when I call getUsers().”

Later, your UserRepositoryImpl will fulfill that promise by actually calling the API.
