The heart of the app. Pure business logic — no Flutter, no HTTP, no shared prefs.

Contains:

*entities/ → Core business objects (e.g., UserEntity).
*repositories/ → Abstract contracts defining what the app can do (e.g., UserRepository).
*usecases/ → Classes that represent a single action (e.g., GetUserData, CacheUserData).

🧩 The Domain layer only defines what to do, not how it’s done.
The Data layer implements these contracts.

In pure clean architecture, the rule is:
“Domain entities must not depend on external layers.”
-----------------------------------------------------

🧩 Why Separate All of This?

Because separation = flexibility.

Here’s the magic:

*If you switch from Dio to Http, domain doesn’t care.
*If you switch from REST API to GraphQL, domain doesn’t care.
*If you switch from online data to cached local data, domain doesn’t care.

The domain just keeps doing its job — describing the business logic, not the implementation.
